### Exercises 1.10

- The set of players: $S=\{s_1,...,s_I\}=\{n_1,...,n_I\}$

- The strategy space of players: 

- The payoff function for player i: $u_i(n_1,...,n_I)=n_iv(\sum n_i)-n_i c$

  

Let's assume that $n_i$ is the total number of cows that raised by players other than player i.

Now we need to determine i's best response function $r_i$
